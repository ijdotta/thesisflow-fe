# Public Access Analytics - Ready to Implement ✅

## Documents Prepared

All specification and planning documents have been created and are ready for review:

### 1. **LIBRARY_RECOMMENDATIONS.md** 📚
Comprehensive analysis of which libraries to use and why:
- **Recharts** for timeline charts (70 KB)
- **ECharts** for heatmaps (200 KB)
- **vis-network** for professor collaboration network (250 KB)
- **TanStack Table** for statistics (already installed)

**Total bundle impact: ~520 KB** (acceptable for analytics feature)

### 2. **BE_PUBLIC_API_SPEC.md** 🔌
Complete backend API specification with 6 endpoints:
1. `GET /projects/public` - Browse projects
2. `GET /analytics/filters` - Metadata for UI
3. `GET /analytics/thesis-timeline` - Thesis per prof/year
4. `GET /analytics/topic-heatmap` - Topic popularity
5. `GET /analytics/professor-network` - Collaboration network
6. `GET /analytics/career-year-stats` - Stats per career/year

Each endpoint includes:
- Query parameters
- Response format (JSON examples)
- Notes and calculation rules
- Error handling

### 3. **IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_PUBLIC_VIEW.md** 🛠️
Complete implementation roadmap with:
- 8 phases of development (10 hours total)
- File structure to create
- Code examples
- Router changes needed
- Performance considerations
- Accessibility checklist
- Testing strategy

## What's Next

### For Backend Engineer ✨

Share **`BE_PUBLIC_API_SPEC.md`** with your backend team. They need to implement:

```
POST /projects/public
GET /analytics/filters
GET /analytics/thesis-timeline
GET /analytics/topic-heatmap
GET /analytics/professor-network
GET /analytics/career-year-stats
```

**Key requirements:**
- ✅ All endpoints publicly accessible (no auth required)
- ✅ Pre-aggregated data (frontend just renders)
- ✅ Support filters: careerIds, professorIds, fromYear, toYear
- ✅ JSON responses only

**Estimated backend effort:** 4-6 hours

---

### For Frontend Implementation 🚀

Once backend endpoints are ready:

1. **Checkout new branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout master && git pull
   git checkout -b feat/public-access-analytics
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install recharts echarts use-echarts vis-network
   ```

3. **Follow IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_PUBLIC_VIEW.md:**
   - Phase 1: Setup (30 min)
   - Phase 2: Browse page (1-2 hours)
   - Phase 3: Analytics shell (1 hour)
   - Phase 4-7: Build each chart (5 hours)
   - Phase 8: Polish (1-2 hours)

**Total frontend effort:** ~10 hours

## Key Decision Summary

| Question | Decision | Rationale |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Chart library for timeline? | **Recharts** | Lightweight, perfect for time-series |
| Chart library for heatmap? | **ECharts** | Best heatmap support, professional |
| Graph library for network? | **vis-network** | Force-directed, interactive |
| Table library? | **TanStack Table** | Already installed, lightweight |
| Bundle impact? | **~520 KB** | Acceptable for analytics feature |
| Public or protected? | **Public** | No authentication required |
| Caching strategy? | **TanStack Query** | 5 min stale time, already in use |
| Auth for endpoints? | **None** | All endpoints publicly accessible |

## Quick Reference

### Documents to Share

📄 **With Backend Team:**
- `BE_PUBLIC_API_SPEC.md` - API contracts and examples

📄 **With Frontend Team:**
- `LIBRARY_RECOMMENDATIONS.md` - Library choices and rationale
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_PUBLIC_VIEW.md` - Step-by-step implementation guide

---

## Questions to Ask Backend Team

Before they start implementation, clarify:

1. **Date field:** Use `initialSubmission` or `completion` for year extraction?
2. **Sparse data:** Include years with 0 projects in responses?
3. **Caching:** Recommended TTL for analytics endpoints?
4. **Performance:** Expected response time for large datasets?
5. **Pagination:** Any limits on `/projects/public` page size?

---

## Success Metrics

✅ Public site accessible without login
✅ Browse page shows all projects with working filters
✅ All 4 charts render and update with filters
✅ Interactive visualizations (hover, tooltips, drag)
✅ Responsive on mobile/tablet/desktop
✅ < 2 seconds initial load time
✅ No console errors
✅ Meets WCAG accessibility standards

---

## Timeline Estimate

| Phase | Task | Duration |
|-------|------|----------|
| Backend | Implement 6 endpoints | 4-6 hours |
| Frontend Setup | Install deps, project structure | 0.5 hours |
| Frontend Browse | Browse page + filters | 1.5 hours |
| Frontend Analytics | Shell + context | 1 hour |
| Frontend Charts | 4 charts (timeline, heatmap, network, table) | 5 hours |
| Frontend Polish | Responsive, loading, errors, testing | 2 hours |
| **TOTAL** | | **14-16 hours** |

## Files Created

✅ `LIBRARY_RECOMMENDATIONS.md` - Full library analysis and rationale
✅ `BE_PUBLIC_API_SPEC.md` - Backend API specification
✅ `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_PUBLIC_VIEW.md` - Frontend implementation roadmap
✅ `BE_ANALYTICS_SPEC.md` - Original BE analytics requirements (already existed)
